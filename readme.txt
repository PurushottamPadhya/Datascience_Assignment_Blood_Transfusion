===Description===

**Jupiter Notebook is an application used to create documents which contains live codes and for data science applications. 
Not only jupiter Nootbook contains images and sections for easy navigation but also we can perfoem stepwise execution of each code snippnets which provides better learing experience.

To access the s3815946_s3825301.ipynb file, simply download and extract the s3815946_s3825301.zip folder from the uploaded assignment. Similarly download the 'Blood Transfusion Service Center' Data Set in order to run the .ipynb file.
We highly recommend Jupiter Notebook to be used to work with the .ipynb file as it was created using same application. Create a new folder in jupiter notebook and in that uplaod the s3815946_s3825301.ipynb file and the downloaded data set file. 
Once the files are uploaded click open the s3815946_s3825301.ipynb file and  start executing the each code snippnets and wait for the result to be displayed.
